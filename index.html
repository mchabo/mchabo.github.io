        <p>Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination…..producing works to be
            appreciated primarily primarily for their beauty or emotional power. It can also be defined as a diverse
            range of human activities in creating visual,auditory or performing artifacts(artworks),expressing the
            uthors imaginative,conceptual ideas, or technical skill,intended to be appreciated for their beauty or
            emotional power.</p>

    <div id="p2">

        <p>Art is important because it encompasses all the developmental domains in child development. Art lends itself
            to physical development and the enhancement of fine and gross motor skills. Art activities also help
            children’s social and emotional development. Children learn about themselves and others through art
            activities. It really helps them build self-
            esteem.
            Finally, art is important because it allows children to be creative.  Art is open-ended and all work can
            be honored

        <p>Why do you make art? That’s the simple question Greater Good posed to seven artists. Their answers are surprising, and very diverse. They mention making art for fun and adventure; building bridges between themselves and the rest of humanity; reuniting and recording fragments of thought, feeling, and memory; and saying things that they can’t express in any other way.
