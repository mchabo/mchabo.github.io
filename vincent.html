    <p><b>Vincent</b>Vincent van Gogh was a post-Impressionist painter whose work — notable for its beauty, emotion and
        color — highly influenced 20th-century art. He struggled with mental illness and remained poor and virtually
        unknown throughout his life.

        Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. Van Gogh’s father, Theodorus van Gogh, was
        an austere country minister, and his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was a moody artist whose love of nature,
        drawing and watercolors was transferred to her son.

        Van Gogh was born exactly one year after his parents' first son, also named Vincent, was stillborn. At a young
        age — with his name and birthdate already etched on his dead brother's headstone — van Gogh was melancholy.
